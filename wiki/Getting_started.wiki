The !ArduPirates project focuses on speeding up development on [http://code.google.com/p/arducopter/wiki/ArduCopter_Quad ArduCopter] especially by integrating self controlling mechanisms without any commercial interests or targets.
 
The base of this project is Hein's Code which is an exit of the "official" [http://code.google.com/p/arducopter/ ArduCopter Code]. 

First project was the Arducopter Super Stable Code by Hein and Phil with GPS Hold.

Then, the further development of the "official" Arducopter NG code was taken over by the Pirates.

!ArduPirates are now teaming up and joining forces with the Arducopter Team.

Read DIYDrones founder Chris Anderson's blog announcement [http://diydrones.ning.com/profiles/b...-taken-over-by here]

*What the Pirates have to offer:*

 * Working Sparkfun Magnetometer
 * GPS hold
 * Altitude hold with Barometer and Sonar
 * Automatic camera leveling plus an automatic camera trigger! 

Even more: Hein's code applies to Hexa builds. Octocopters are on the way thanks to Peter Seddon.
