===Acrobatic Mode===
Acrobatic mode is a `PID` rate control.  The `I` term is not needed (usually 0).  `D` should be a low value (start with `D=0`).  The `P` term is the main parameter.  You should start by increasing `P` until the !ArduCopter starts to oscillate and then reduce the `P` parameter a little bit.

===Stable Mode===
On the current version of stable mode, there are two controls. 
The first one is an outer control that is a PI absolute control which drives an inner control that is a P_rate control (_In the configurator, this is labeled as `D`. It will be changed to `P_rate`_).

This approach utilizing two controls instead of the normal `PID` has proved to be much better.  Because of this, the `D`, or `P_rate`, parameter is important and shouldn't be zero.

===Control Adjustment Guidelines===
If you haven't adjusted your Acrobatic mode parameters, just use the default.  The `P_rate` value in Stable mode should be a little lower than the `P` value in Acrobatic mode.  _For example, a `P` rate in Acrobatic mode could be 1.9 and the `P_rate` in Stable mode could be 1.2._  If the `P_rate` is too high, you will see quick oscillations on the !ArduCopter. If the values are too low, it will be unstable.  The `I` term can be thought of like the trim on your radio; it is needed to account for differences in motors, ESCs, etc.  Its value will be low, likely between 0.1 and 0.4.  The `P` parameter is the main authority of the outer control.  If its value is too low, the quad will be lazy and slow to respond to stick movements.  If it is too high, instability will develop and the !ArduCopter will oscillate.

*Since control tuning is difficult, it is recommended that you start with the default values and only change one value at a time.*
