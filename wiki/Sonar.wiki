== Sonar ==

([http://code.google.com/p/arducopter/wiki/Quad_Sonar ArduCopter's source])

ArduPiratesNG supports the !MaxSonar line of sonars for low level altitude hold and in the future collision avoidance.

Note: these feature is not included in [http://code.google.com/p/arducopter/downloads/detail?name=ArduCopter%20RC2.zip ArduCopterNG RC2].

== Low Altitude Hold ==

Due to the narrow beam width, the recommended sonars for altitude hold are the [http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8504 Maxbotix LV-EZ4] and [http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9495 XL-Maxsonar EZ4]

*Connecting the Sonar:*
 * Attach the sonar to the body of the quad facing downwards, clear of the battery and anything else that might accidentally pass in front of the sensor
 * Wiring the sonar to the APM is nearly identical for the types supported:
   * The sensor's GND, V+ and "AN" or "3" pins should be connected to the !OilPan's Pitot tube GND, +5V and IN pins as shown in the diagram below
