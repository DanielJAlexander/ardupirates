 First of all, you need an Electronic Brain to control your PirateShip.

The minimum required parts are:

 * *[http://store.diydrones.com/product_p/pr-0003-03-5cm.htm Servo cable]* (6pcs. needed to connect your rx)

The next parts are required if you are planning to use a GPS. You will need it to use the Position Hold flight mode.

 * *Magnetometer & Cable*: Use either
  * the DIYDrones one ([http://store.diydrones.com/HMC5843_Triple_Axis_Magnetometer_p/br-hmc5843-01.htm HMC5843 - Triple Axis Magnetometer Rev 1.2])
  * or  the Sparkfun one ([http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9371 Triple Axis Magnetometer Breakout - HMC5843])

If you want to use a Ublock GPS instead of MediaTek, you should read this [UbloxGPSTutorial how-to]
  ==Frame==
 there is a lot different frames in online stores, and you can build your custom one. One of the Pirates Team members, Jakub, is selling some nice frames [http://quadframe.com here], and you may find others in [http://www.ardupirates.com/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=1 the ArduPirateShop]

 ==Motors, ESC's and Propellers==
 [http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1097355 Jesolin's Mega Index] is a really interesting source of informations about multicopters, and you will find all you need to make your setup!

 A great resource for informations on motors is Old Man Mike's regularly updated thread:

 ==Radio and Battery==
 You can use your own Tx and Rx system, the ArduPilot Mega Board is working with quite all systems.

 Most of multicopters are working with Lipo batteries, in 3S (11,1V) or 4S (14,8V). You can choose your own setup, depending on your motors and ESC's abilities.
