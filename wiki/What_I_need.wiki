 ==Motors, ESC's and Propellers==
 [http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1097355 Jesolin's Mega Index] is a really interesting source of informations about multicopters, and you will find all you need to make your setup!

 ==Radio and Battery==
 You can use your own Tx and Rx system, the ArduPilot Mega Board is working with quite all systems.

 Most of multicopters are working with Lipo batteries, in 3S (11,1V) or 4S (14,8V). You can choose your own setup, depending on your motors and ESC's abilities.
